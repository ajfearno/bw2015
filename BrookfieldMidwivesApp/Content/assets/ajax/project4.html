        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">Mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the baby.
        Mother and baby need to be together early and often to establish a satisfying relationship and an adequate milk supply.
        In the early years the baby has an intense need to be with his mother which is as basic as his need for food.</div>
